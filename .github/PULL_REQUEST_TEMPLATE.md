# Consent Manager Integration for GDPR-Compliant Video Embedding

## Summary

This PR removes the internal consent system from Vidstack and integrates directly with the **Consent Manager AddOn** for GDPR-compliant YouTube/Vimeo video embedding.

## Breaking Changes ⚠️

### Removed Features
- ❌ `generateConsentPlaceholder()` method
- ❌ Internal localStorage/Cookie consent management
- ❌ Consent placeholder HTML generation
- ❌ Consent JavaScript logic (~140 lines removed from `vidstack_helper.js`)
- ❌ Consent CSS styles (`.consent-placeholder`, `.consent-button`)

### Changed Behavior
- `generateFull()` now calls `consent_manager_inline::doConsent()` for YouTube/Vimeo
- `generate()` always sets `src` attribute directly (no more `data-video-platform`)
- Videos load directly if Consent Manager AddOn is not installed

## New Features ✨

### Direct API Integration
- ✅ Calls `consent_manager_inline::doConsent()` directly (no output filter scanning)
- ✅ Automatic consent placeholder for YouTube/Vimeo when Consent Manager is installed
- ✅ Poster image automatically used as consent placeholder thumbnail
- ✅ Graceful degradation when Consent Manager is not available

### Simplified JavaScript
- ✅ `vidstack_helper.js` reduced from ~200 to ~60 lines (translation support only)
- ✅ No more consent state management in JavaScript
- ✅ Better performance (no DOM scanning)

## Changes Made

### PHP (`lib/Video.php`)
```php
// Before: Manual consent placeholder generation
if ($videoInfo['platform'] !== 'default') {
    $code .= $this->generateConsentPlaceholder($consentText, $platform, $videoId);
}

// After: Direct Consent Manager API call
if ($videoInfo['platform'] !== 'default' && class_exists('consent_manager_inline')) {
    $playerCode = consent_manager_inline::doConsent($serviceKey, $playerCode, $options);
}
```

### JavaScript (`assets/vidstack_helper.js`)
- Removed: `setConsent()`, `hasConsent()`, `loadVideo()`, `initializePlaceholder()`
- Kept: `loadTranslations()`, `applyTranslations()`
- Result: ~140 lines removed

### CSS (`assets/vidstack_helper.css`)
- Removed: `.consent-placeholder` and `.consent-button` styles

### Documentation
- ✅ Added `CONSENT_MANAGER_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete migration guide
- ✅ Added `INTEGRATION_FLOW.md` - Visual architecture diagrams
- ✅ Updated `README.md` - New GDPR section with integration instructions

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
**No code changes required!** Your existing PHP code continues to work:

```php
// This code works unchanged
$video = new Video('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyz', 'Title');
$video->setPoster('thumb.jpg', 'Preview');
echo $video->generateFull();
```

### For System Administrators
1. Install Consent Manager AddOn (if not already installed)
2. Create services with UIDs: `youtube` and `vimeo` (lowercase!)
3. Configure consent texts and themes

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All public methods unchanged (`generate()`, `generateFull()`, `setPoster()`, etc.)
- ✅ Works with or without Consent Manager
- ⚠️ `generateConsentPlaceholder()` removed (private method, should not affect users)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Local video (mp4) plays directly without consent
- [ ] YouTube video shows consent placeholder (with Consent Manager)
- [ ] Vimeo video shows consent placeholder (with Consent Manager)
- [ ] YouTube/Vimeo loads directly without Consent Manager installed
- [ ] Poster image appears in consent placeholder
- [ ] After consent, video plays correctly
- [ ] Multiple videos on same page work correctly
- [ ] Backend video preview still works

## Architecture

### Before (Internal Consent)
```
Vidstack generates → Placeholder HTML → JavaScript manages consent → Loads video
```

### After (Consent Manager Integration)
```
Vidstack calls → consent_manager_inline::doConsent() → Returns placeholder or video
```

See `INTEGRATION_FLOW.md` for detailed architecture diagrams.

## Benefits

### For Developers
- ✅ Less code to maintain
- ✅ Central consent management (one AddOn for videos, maps, analytics, etc.)
- ✅ Consistent UX across all external content
- ✅ Better separation of concerns

### For Users
- ✅ Unified consent experience
- ✅ One place to manage all cookies/consents
- ✅ Multiple theme variants available
- ✅ Better accessibility (Consent Manager is A11y-optimized)

### Technical
- ✅ ~140 lines of JavaScript removed
- ✅ No duplicate consent logic
- ✅ Direct API calls instead of DOM scanning
- ✅ Better performance

## Required Consent Manager Services

The following services must be created in Consent Manager:

**YouTube Service:**
- UID: `youtube` (must be exactly this!)
- Service Name: YouTube
- Provider: Google/YouTube

**Vimeo Service:**
- UID: `vimeo` (must be exactly this!)
- Service Name: Vimeo
- Provider: Vimeo

## Documentation

All integration details documented in:
- `CONSENT_MANAGER_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete guide with examples
- `INTEGRATION_FLOW.md` - Visual architecture and flow diagrams
- `README.md` - Updated with GDPR section

## Related Issues

Closes #XX (if applicable)

## Additional Notes

- Tested with Consent Manager v3.x
- Requires Consent Manager AddOn for GDPR compliance
- Local videos (mp4, webm, etc.) are never blocked
- Poster images automatically used as consent thumbnails
